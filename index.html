                <p>Under the city of light lies the maze of darkness, a tourist attraction, burial ground, mine, refuge for revolutionaries even wartime tunnel system for troops of different factions. The catacombs are all of these things and more depending on who you ask! Even though the main attraction is 2 km long that is open to the public, the actual tunnel system runs 320 km long underneath Paris. Read about the history of the making of these scary yet fascinating catacombs, the reasons behind them, and the modern approach of tourist and law breaking explorers alike. </p>

            <p>
                The tunnel system began about when limestone was mined for the construction of Paris. This began quite some time ago, dating back to the Roman empire, and continued to medieval times, it was more convenient for workers to mine underneath the city than transport stone form afar. Now what could go wrong with digging holes in the earth that holds your city? The church of Notre Dame was build from these very stones and much of Paris, until December 1774 a collapse occurred under the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau, destroying housing and swallowing people. More incidents occurred over the coming years until king Louis XVI took action and hired a architect Charles Axel Guillaumot to find a solution to this problem.
Now to better understand the origin of the millions of bones located in the catacombs we must mention Les Innocents cemetery, it was common practice to bury remains in this central cemetery, even despite a royal decree banning all city burials in 1763, the church opposed this and continued the practice that began in the 10th century. Hundreds of years later a morbid incident occurred, during heavy rain in 1780, walls holding the now overflowing remains collapsed, an avalanche of corpses and sludge seeped across the neighborhood, so now the problem was at everyone’s doorstep. 
Now back to the architect, he already examined the tunnel system and connected some separated instances, now the idea was born to exhume millions of dead and fill the tunnels thus creating the catacombs we know today.
